    "#### Covered Concepts: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. <b> Combinational vs. Sequential circuits </b>: The former type of circuit has output that strictly depends on the current input. The later circuit has output that output that depends on previous input, i.e. it has memory. <br> <br>\n",
    "2. <b> SR latch </b>: Two NAND gates feeding eachother. This is the simplest controllable sequential circuit that can be used to save 1 bit .  <br><br>\n",
    "3. <b> D latch </b>: Improved version of SR latch. Its input D is memorized when CLK = 1. D latch gives precedence to CLK over D, i.e. D is ignored when CLK = 0. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "4. <b> D flipflop </b>: Sequential circuit that saves its input D upon a rising edge of CLK. It is a fundamental building block of synchronous sequential circuits. <br><br>\n",
    "5. <b> Register </b>: Defined as a multiple D flip flops. <br><br> \n",
    "\n",
    "6. <b> Setup time constraint </b>: States there has to a minimum time interval between when a register's input value settles and the next rising edge occurs. In other words, combinational circuits between registers should not be too slow. If the constrainted is violated, it can be fixed by either increasing the clock period of reducing the combinational circuit's propagation delay.  <br><br>\n",
    "7. <b> Hold time constraint </b>: States there has to be a minimum time interval between a register's clock rising edge and its input going into perturbation. In other words, the combinational circuits between registers should not be too fast. If the constrainted is violated, it can be fixed by increasing the pertubation delay of the combinational circuit causing trouble by adding buffers. <br><br>\n",
    "8. <b> Synchronous sequential circuits </b>: There are 4 criteria for a circuit to be synchronous sequential: 1. Every element of the circuit is either a combinational circuit or a register, 2. there is at least one register, 3. every cyclic path contains at least one register and 4. every register is connected to the same clock. <br><br>\n",

    "#### Exercises 3.7\n",
    "The presence of a loop suggests the circuit might be sequential instead of combinational. From its truth table, one can assert it behaves exactly like the SR latch mades of NOR gates presented in section 3.2.1, with the exeption of when $R = S = 1$. The circuit has memory, thus it is sequential.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $R = S = 1$ are not valid inputs for an SR latch, the provided circuit can be expected to behaves just like a NOR-based SR latch. \n",

    "Assuming R and S remain at 0, the circuit behaves like a D flip flop. R acts as an asynchronous reset to the circuit and S acts as an asynchronous set to the circuit. That mean R = 1 makes Q latch to 0 and S = 1 makes Q latch to 1, both until the next rising edge. In this specific circuit, S = 1 has precedence over R = 1. \n",
