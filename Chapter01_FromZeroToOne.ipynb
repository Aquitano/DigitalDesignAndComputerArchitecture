    "(a) <b> Hierarchy</b> can be used to split the car design into different systems (e.g. powertrain, chassis , suspension) and finer subsystems (e.g. powertrain can be decomposed into the engine, transmission, clutch, etc). <b>Modularity</b> is used to define the function and interface between the subsystems. For instance, the chassis mounts everything together, the powertrain provides tractions and the suspension dampens vertical impacts. <b>Regularity</b> can be used to uniformize the subsystems. E.g. different car models may use the same dampers models or the same chassis fasteners. \n",

    "<b>Hierarchy</b> can be used to split the houses into sections, e.g. : 1. foundation, 2. framing, 3. walls, 4. roof, etc. <br>\n",
    "<b>Modularity</b> can be used to infer function to each sections. The lower foundation must be rigid and support framing, the framing must support walls and allow for wires/plumbing routing, walls must be soundproof and the roof water resistant. <br>\n",
    "<b>Regularity</b> is used to simplify construction. Every section is made of a small but different set of available material (e.g. foundation requires concrete, framing requires wood/nails, etc). Also every section can be made of a repeated pattern, e.g. the same roof pattern extends all across the top of the house. \n",

    "Ben is right. Proof: It is possible to transition from a two's complement to its original negative number's magnitude by flipping the bits and adding one (see example 1.11). The reverse process is to subtract one and flip the bit.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Alyssa is also right: adding a 1 to a binary number is equivalent to flipping the N+1 left significant bits where N is the number of consecutive zeros starting from the lsb. If the binary number is flipped before a 1 is added, then the final result is equivalent to keeping the N+1 least significant bit unchanged and flip the other bits. This is identical to what Alyssa suggests.\n",
