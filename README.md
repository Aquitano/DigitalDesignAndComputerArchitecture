# DigitalDesignAndComputerArchitecture

Solutions to Digital Design and Computer Architecture 2nd edition. 

The solution to almost all exerices should be present. I wrote them myself as as a self-studying method. Contributions/comments are welcomed. 

A few notes: 
- Schematics in the `images` directory were made using https://draw.io/
- Questions involving HDL programming were all answered using Verilog, and not VDHL.  
- `iverilog` was used as a Verilog compiler. It can installed from this repo: https://github.com/steveicarus/iverilog
- GTKWave was used to display the Verilog simulation output signals for debugging, which was especially useful for Chapter 7. It can installed from: https://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/
