# DigitalDesignAndComputerArchitecture

Solutions to Digital Design and Computer Architecture 2nd edition. 

The solutions to almost all exercises should be present. I wrote them as a self-studying method. Contributions/comments are welcomed. 

A few notes: 
- Schematics in the `images` directory were made using https://draw.io/
- Questions involving HDL programming were all answered using Verilog.   
- `iverilog` was used as a Verilog compiler. It can be installed from this repo: https://github.com/steveicarus/iverilog
- GTKWave was used to display the Verilog simulation output signals for debugging, which was especially useful for Chapter 7. It can be downloaded from: https://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/
